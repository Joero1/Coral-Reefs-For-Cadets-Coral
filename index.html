<h1>Coral Biology</h1>
  
 <h2>Species</h2>
 <p>There are an estimated 600-800 species of hard corals. Estimates vary depending on sources. There is some disagreement regarding what counts as separate species and what is merely two sub-members of one species.) The number of soft coral species is even harder to determine.</p>
 
  <br>
  
  <h2>Anatomy</h2>
 <p>The fleshy part of the coral is called a <strong>polyp</strong>. Each polyp has tentacles that allow the corals to catch food. The entire coral structure consists of genetically identical polyps, produced asexually from one another. The polyp absorbs calcium carbonate from the surrounding water and secretes it around itself to provide a hard protective structure. This structure is called a <strong>corallite</strong>. The texture of hard corals normally looks like bumpy stones. Each 'bumb' is a corallite and has an associated polyp living within it. The polyps are connected to one another by connective tissue. Within this tissue are tubes that allow them to equally distribute food and other resources among themselves. The polyps also contain stinging cells. These are used for defence and to inject small prey to stun them and bring them towards the 'mouth' of the polyp for consuming.</p>

  <p>Hard corals grow very slowly. This makes them vulnerable to disturbance because damaging a small piece can destroy several decades worth of growth. The first generation lays down their calcium carbonate skeleton for future generations to build upon. Only the outer layer of the coral contains living tissue.</p>

  <br>
  
  <h2>Reproduction</h2>
 <p>Corals reproduce sexually. This allows genetic diversity. Without this, diseases would be more at risk of of wiping out entire populations. Corals can be male or female but the majority are hermaphrodites (both). They may be both at the same time or may be males in their early stage of life and then become female. Most corals reproduce by release sex cells into the water so that it may hopefully meet with those released from other colonies and fuse in the water. For this reason, corals normally synchronise their spawning by using lunar cycles, happening at very specific nights of the year. When this happens they get fertilised in the water. The larvae develops and is part of the plankton for a while before eventually finding a suitable substrate and settling on the benthos. This technique allows corals to drive far before settling, so as to spread their genes across a wide distribution. Once a larvae settles, it will grow into a polyp and start secreting calcium carbonate to stabilise itself. It will then start dividing asexually to form a new colony.</p>

  <h2>Zooxanthellae</h2>
 <p>Zooxanthellae are type of dinoflagellate algae in the genus <em>Symbiodinium</em>. They are embedded in the fleshy tissue of the coral. Zooxanthellae are initially taken up by the coral when it is in it's larval stage in the water column but it continues to obtain them throughout it's life via it's feeding mechanisms. The striking colours of corals are provided by the zooxanthellae due to the prigments they possess to absorb various lightwaves. A typical coral obtains most of it's nutrients from its zooxanthellae. These algae produce their own food using energy from the sun. The coral and the zooxanthellae have a <strong>symbiotic relationship</strong>. This means that they benefit each other. The coral gains carbohydrates from the zooxanthellae, needed to meet their energy demands. The zooxanthellae gain protection from the coral. They can exist freely in the water column but are more likely to be grazed by animals if they do. The zooxanthellae can also make use of some of the metabolic waste products from the coral, e.g. carbon dioxide and ammonium. Scientists group zooxanthellae by clades from A to E. Each clade has slight differences in their properties.</p>

  <br><br>
  
  <h2>Other Feeding Mechanisms</h2>
  <p>A typical coral obtains about 80% of its nutrients from the photosynthesis of zooxanthellae. The other 20% comes from consuming other animals. The deeper down a coral lives, the more this percentage increases due to a decrease in sunlight. The polyps have sticky tentacles that can catch plankton and pass them to the mouth of the polyp where they will be ingested. The coral's stinging cells are also used for catching slightly larger prey. They are sensitive to vibrations in the water. When they detect prey swimming by, they trigger a small appendage called a cnidocyte that will fire into the prey and real it in to be ingested. The cnidocyte typically contains neurotoxins that disorientate and immobilize the prey.</p>

  <h2>Growth Forms</h2>
  <p>We can group hard corals by growth forms. A variety of growth forms is important on a reef because it creates high structurall complexity and this opens up lots of suitable habitat and shelter for organisms. Many coral species can take on several growth forms depending on the environmental conditions.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Branching - </strong>Tree-like shape with branches coming out of a central point and there are secondary branches on these. They are often found in areas of high wave action. This is because they are particularly fast-growing and therefore tend to be the first to recolonize an area after storm damage.<br><br>

    <br><br>
    <strong>Submassive - </strong>Sturdy columns and do not have the secondary branches that branching corals have. They are slower growing than branching corals and are generally found at greater depths as they are slower to recolonize damaged areas.<br><br>

    <br><br>
    <strong>Massive - </strong>Boulder-like structures. They are the slowest growing but also can grow to be the biggest and oldest. Some structures are many hundreds of years old. This is because they have the most sturdy structures and so are the most resistant to mechanical damage. They are often found with small animals living on them. For example, christmas tree worms often drill into their structure.<br><br>

    <br><br>
    <strong>Encrusting - </strong>Flat corals that follow the contours of the reef. Many corals will often take on an encrusting form when they initially colonize. But the base that this provides will act as the foundations for them to expand into another growth form.<br><br>

    <br><br>
    <strong>Plate - </strong>These start out as branching corals but the branches become denser and cause a thick mesh that gives the coral a table-like appearance as the branches radiate out from the central stem.<br><br>

    <br><br>
    <strong>Foliose - </strong>Named for their leaf-like structure and often look like lettuce. Their shape allows them to live in areas that have higher sedimentation than other growth forms can tolerate. Most corals struggle in places of high sedimentation as it will settle on the corals and block out the light and smother the feeding appendages. The shape of foliose corals makes it hard for sediment to settle on.<br><br>

    <br><br>
    <strong>Mushroom - </strong>This growth form is only adopted by one coral family - Fungidae. Unlike other corals, each structure has just one polyp. They are so-called because the skeleton looks like an upturned mushroom. It has ridges that mimic that of a mushroom.
